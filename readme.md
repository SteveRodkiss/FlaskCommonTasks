# Flask Recipes  
  
This is a series of mini flask projects that show how to do a number of the most common tasks that I expect to see at level 2 and 3 Software Engineering.  
The projects, in approximate order of complexity are:  
1. QuickStart  
A basic structure and starter app
2. RenderingHTML  
How to structure the templates folder and render an html file instead of text
3. SQLiteBasics  
How to add a simple sqlite database to the app and do a simple query
4. SQLiteQueries  
An improvement on the sqlite trying to streamline the query process
5. Using Forms  
Take basic input from a form, post it to a route and read the form items into python code
6. TemplateInheritance  
Don;t Repeat Yourself concept to create a base html template that other pages inherit from. Makes your life a LOT easier
7. SimpleImages  
Display images the right way by storing the image files in your static folder and the filename in your database. This reads the filename in a query and sends them all to the html template to display as images
8. DynamicRoutes  
Basic variable rules to send data to a route. Used commonly to allow queries to find info about a particular item in our database and ONLY display info about that item on it's own dynamically generated page.
9. SessionStorage  
A great way to store info across the session like the user who is logged in. Stored in cookies and available to the whole app, even in the templates!
10. SimpleUserLogin  
A bit more in depth- several simple routes to log in, sign up, log out. Uses a database of users and HASHES the passwword before storing it. Quick and Dirty and OK for a start. Like before, storees the user in the session so we can, for example, only render admin pages to a certain user(s) or add items to the correct users shopping cart.
